# Zoom Clone

A full-featured Zoom clone built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and WebRTC for real-time video conferencing. 

## Features

==> High-quality video and audio calls
==> Real-time chat during meetings
==> Screen sharing functionality
==> User authentication (JWT-based)
==> Room management with unique meeting links
==> Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
==> Secure and scalable architecture

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a real-time video conferencing application similar to Zoom, using the MERN stack and WebRTC. This project demonstrates how to integrate peer-to-peer communication, real-time messaging, and screen sharing functionalities in a web application.

### It is designed to provide:
==> Seamless communication with high-quality video and audio
==> Real-time collaboration through chat and screen sharing
==> Scalability and security with user authentication and encrypted connections

This project serves as a learning resource for developers interested in building real-time applications with WebRTC, Socket.io, and the MERN stack.
